    <string name="faqs">FAQs</string>
    <string name="unidetails">
	.......Details.......\n\n
-> Patch :- Patch License Check Of The Target App, It Need To Be Unpatch Before Updating The Target App.\n\n
-> Unpatch :- Remove Patch From The Target App, It Returns Target App To Normal Unlicensed State, Should Be Used To Remove Patch Before Updating The Target App.\n\n
-> Support Patch :- Support Patch For Apps To Work With Patch Or Emulation, Should Be Applied First Before Using Either Patch Or Emulation.\n\n
-> Support Emulate :- Patch Target App For License And Billing Emulation To Work With Root, If You Have Xposed Then You Do Not Need This As Xposed Module Will Take Care Of This Itself, It Is Alternate Of \'Select Apps\' Option In Emulation.\n\n
-> Remove Ads :- Remove Google Ads From The Target App.\n\n
        .......Note.......\n\n
-> If You Apply Support Patch And Patch Both Then Make Sure Support Patch Should Be Applied First Before Patch.\n\n
-> Only User Installed Apps Are Shown In List.\n
    </string>
    <string name="emudetails">
        .......Details.......\n\n
-> License Emulation :- It Does Not Require Play Store Installed Or Internet Connection And It Redirect License Check To Patcher, It Can Be Used Without Xposed But Require \'Support Emulate\' Patch To Target App From Universal Patch UI.\n\n
-> Billing Emulation :- It Does Not Require Play Store Installed Or Internet Connection And It Redirect Billing Purchase To Patcher, It Can Be Used Without Xposed But Require \'Support Emulate\' Patch To Target App From Universal Patch UI.\n\n
-> License Hook (Removed In v3.0) :- It Does Require Play Store Installed As Well As Internet Connection On Verification And It Will Intercept Play Store For Requests And Responses, Xposed Is Mandatory So Can Not Be Used Without Xposed.\n\n
-> Select Apps :- Select The Apps You Want To Emulate, By Default All User Installed Apps Are Selected, If You Unselect Any App Then Even If Emulation Is Turned ON That App Won\'t Be Hooked, Should Be Used To Exclude Legal Bought Apps, It Require Xposed So If You Do Not Have Xposed Then Use \'Support Emulate\' Option On Target App From Universal Patch Which Is Alternate Of This Option.\n\n
        .......Note.......\n\n
-> Always Check \'Store Purchase\' Option While Purchasing A Non Consumable Item But Never In Consumable Item.\n
Non Consumable :- Premium, Pro Etc In Apps.\n
Consumable :- Coins, Gems Etc In Games.\n\n
-> After Turning OFF Billing Emulation, Some Apps With Non Consumable Items Will Revert Back To Free State But When You Turn It ON Again It Will Be Back To Bought State, So It Is Better To Keep Billing Emulation Turned ON So It Work Reliable Because These Apps Keep Synchronizing Purchases.\n\n
-> Also After Turning OFF License Emulation, Some Apps Ask For License Again Because They Keep Synchronizing License, So It Is Better To Keep License Emulation Turned ON So It Work Reliable.\n\n
-> If You Have Legal License Or Legal Purchases, Either Only Select Those Apps You Want Emulation To Work On Or If You Selected All Apps For Emulation Then Turn OFF All License Emulation, Billing Emulation And License Hook Because Anyone Of Them Turned ON Will Create Problem In Legal License And Purchase, You Can Also Use Emulation On Your Real License Or Purchases It Will Work Fine In Most Of The Cases.\n\n
-> Some Apps Use Old Licensing Library, When Licensing Emulation Is Turned On And App Is Not Even Selected In Per App Based List Still They Are Not Licensed From Legal License Because Patcher Interfere Due To Old LVL Library And Per App Based Selection Do Not Work So Turn Off Licensing Emulation And Now It Will Not Interfere In Any License Request, Once Licensed You Can Turn It On Back, Same Goes With Billing Emulation.\n\n
-> If You Do Not Have Xposed Then You Can Use License And Billing Emulation With Root, It Requires \'Support Emulate\' Patch From Universal Patch To Target App But Keep In Mind Root Kind Of Emulation Is Not Even Close To Xposed Kind Of Emulation Which Is A Quality.\n\n
-> Some Applications Have Extra Checks So You Can Also Apply \'Support Patch\' From Universal Patch To Target App To Bypass Those Extra Checks And Then Use Emulation.\n\n
-> Emulation Does Not Need Soft Reboot, After Enabling Any Emulation Just Force Stop That App You Want Emulation To Work On, But It Is Better To Soft Reboot To Work Properly.\n
